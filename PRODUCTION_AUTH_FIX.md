# Production Authentication Fix

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing automatic logout after successful login in Vercel production environment. The login would succeed but immediately redirect back to the login page.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by incompatible cookie settings for production environment:

1. **SameSite Policy**: Using `sameSite: 'none'` in production required additional CORS configuration
2. **Domain Handling**: Incorrect domain settings for Vercel deployments
3. **Cookie Security**: Mismatch between cookie setting and reading in production

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cookie Configuration Updates

**File: `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`**
- Changed `sameSite` from `'none'` to `'lax'` for better compatibility
- Simplified domain handling to let browser manage domains automatically
- Added debug logging for production troubleshooting

**File: `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`**
- Updated `sameSite` setting to match login route
- Maintained comprehensive cookie clearing logic

### 2. Debug Logging

**File: `app/api/auth/me/route.ts`**
- Added console logging to track authentication flow
- Logs host, cookie presence, and user authentication status

### 3. Test Script

**File: `scripts/test-auth.js`**
- Created authentication flow test script
- Can be used to verify login/auth check in any environment

## Cookie Settings Summary

```javascript
const cookieOptions = {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'lax', // Changed from 'none' for better compatibility
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
  path: '/'
}
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing
```bash
node scripts/test-auth.js
```

### Production Testing
```bash
APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app node scripts/test-auth.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Functions tab
4. Check logs for authentication-related console outputs

### Common Issues

1. **Cookies not being set**
   - Check if `secure: true` is appropriate for your domain
   - Verify HTTPS is properly configured

2. **SameSite issues**
   - Ensure your app and API are on the same domain
   - Consider using `sameSite: 'none'` only if cross-site requests are needed

3. **Domain mismatch**
   - Let browser handle domain automatically
   - Avoid hardcoding domains unless necessary

### Debug Steps

1. **Check browser developer tools**
   - Network tab: Verify cookies are being set in login response
   - Application tab: Check if cookies are stored
   - Console: Look for any JavaScript errors

2. **Check Vercel function logs**
   - Look for debug messages from login and auth check endpoints
   - Verify token generation and validation

3. **Test authentication flow**
   - Use the provided test script
   - Check each step of the authentication process

## Security Considerations

- Cookies are HTTP-only to prevent XSS attacks
- Secure flag is enabled in production for HTTPS
- SameSite policy prevents CSRF attacks
- Tokens have 7-day expiration
- Proper domain handling prevents cookie leakage

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL matches your production domain
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is properly configured
- [ ] Database connection is working
- [ ] Test authentication flow after deployment
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify cookies are being set and read correctly

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with development environment
- Debug logging can be removed after confirming the fix works
- Consider implementing additional monitoring for authentication failures
- Regular testing of authentication flow is recommended
